This Script in Bash, I created using Debian 13 Trixie, so I strongly recommend you are using Bash in you system variables for any incompatibility with your current setup.
OPTIONAL: User sudo apt update && Upgrade -y #If you want to have up to date your system first but is not required.
Download the file "firewall_manager.sh" in the directory you want.
give excecution permissions using: sudo chmod +x firewall_manager.sh
sudo ./firewall_manager.sh

The magic will start soon, enjoy.
If you do not want to see my name in the title or in the end, search in the file for Raul Conte and remove from you world :) LOL

ENJOY!!!
